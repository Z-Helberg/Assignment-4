    <h2  class="align-to-paragraph">About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a passionate and creative individual best known for my signature pink hair and bold, expressive style. With a strong background in the beauty industry, I’ve always been drawn to the art of transformation—whether through hair or digital design. Recently, I’ve expanded my skills into the world of front-end development, driven by a desire to grow, learn, and challenge myself in new ways. My journey into coding reflects the same energy I bring to everything I do: vibrant, curious, and constantly evolving. I thrive on blending aesthetics with functionality, and I’m excited to keep building beautiful, user-friendly digital experiences that reflect both my creativity and technical ambition.</p>
